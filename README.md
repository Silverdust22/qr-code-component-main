### What I learned

Positioning QR code component in the middle of the screen was a challenge.After going through you-tube and websites ,I came across CSS-Transform property ,which was helpful for positioning the component in the middle of the screen.Code snippet is as follows:
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
